They are open to trade these bonds on a secondary market (i.e. via LP pools on Sumero)\n */\ncontract ClayBonds is ERC20(\"zClay Token\", \"zCLAY\"), Ownable {\n    IClayToken public clay;\n\n    // the maximum upper limit of bond rewards that this contract will give over it's lifetime\n    uint256 public immutable maximumBondRewards;\n    // total zCLAY bonds locked into the contract\n    uint256 public totalBondDeposits;\n\n    uint256 public immutable depositStartDate;\n    uint256 public immutable depositCloseDate;\n    uint256 public immutable maturationDate;\n\n    uint256 public immutable dailyYieldPercent;\n\n    // TODO: test an APY of 36%\n    uint256 public constant APY_PERCENT = 36;\n\n    // UNCOMMENT BELOW BEFORE PROD\n    // uint256 public constant BONDS_ISSUANCE_PERIOD = 1 days * 365;\n    // uint256 public constant MATURATION_PERIOD = (1 days * 365) * 3;\n\n    // TODO: test claybonds for short duration\n    uint256 public constant BONDS_ISSUANCE_PERIOD = 1 days * 30;\n    uint256 public constant MATURATION_PERIOD = 1 days * 32;\n\n    // minimum staking amount must be 100 wei\n    uint256 public constant MIN_ISSUANCE_AMOUNT = 100;\n\n    constructor(IClayToken _clay, uint256 _maximumBondRewards) {\n        clay = _clay;\n        maximumBondRewards = _maximumBondRewards;\n        depositStartDate = block.timestamp;\n\n        // TODO: take into consideration leap year?\n\n        // deposit close date is 1 year in future\n        depositCloseDate = block.timestamp + BONDS_ISSUANCE_PERIOD;\n        // maturation date of bond is 3 years in future\n        maturationDate = block.timestamp + MATURATION_PERIOD;\n\n        // calculate daily yield\n        // APY details can be taken as constructor argument\n        dailyYieldPercent = (APY_PERCENT * (1 ether)) / 365;\n    }\n\n    function getDaysLeftToMaturationDate()\n        public\n        view\n        returns (uint256 daysLeftToMaturationDate)\n    {\n        if (maturationDate < block.timestamp) {\n            return 0;
